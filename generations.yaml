generations:
  - name: "First Generation (F82/F83)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The inaugural BMW M4 separated the coupe and convertible variants from the M3 lineup, which became sedan-only. Built on the F32/F33 4 Series platform, the F82 coupe and F83 convertible featured extensive modifications including wider fenders, unique bumpers, and a carbon fiber roof on the coupe. Power came from the S55 3.0L twin-turbocharged straight-six engine producing 425 HP (later 444 HP with the Competition Package). Transmission options included a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The M4 offered impressive performance with 0-60 mph times of around 4 seconds. Special editions included the water-injected GTS with 493 HP, the track-focused CS with 454 HP, and various limited editions. The first-generation M4 represented BMW M's transition to turbocharged engines, delivering significantly more torque than its naturally aspirated predecessors."

  - name: "Second Generation (G82/G83)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The current M4 features polarizing styling dominated by a large vertical kidney grille but builds on the performance of its predecessor. Powered by the S58 3.0L twin-turbocharged straight-six engine, it offers 473 HP in standard form and 503 HP in Competition trim. The base M4 comes with a six-speed manual transmission and rear-wheel drive, while the Competition variants feature an eight-speed automatic with optional xDrive all-wheel drive (a first for the M4). The G82 coupe and G83 convertible continue to feature model-specific body panels, suspension, and braking systems. Inside, the second-generation M4 offers a more modern interior with larger displays, advanced driver assistance options, and carbon fiber trim elements. Special models include the track-focused CSL with 543 HP, reduced weight, and rear-wheel drive only. Throughout both generations, the M4 has maintained its position as a high-performance luxury sports coupe, balancing track capability with daily usability."
